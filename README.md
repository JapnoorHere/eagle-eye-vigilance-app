# EagleEyeVigilanceApp

1.This is my first Android Project, Eagle Eye Vigilance App for reporting and addressing corruption issues as my Final Year Project in Diploma. 

2.With its intuitive interface and powerful features, Eagle Eye Vigilance puts the power of accountability right at your fingertips.

3.Through this groundbreaking app, you can voice your concerns and complaints about corruption in a swift and efficient manner. 

4.Say goodbye to the frustrations of bureaucracy and ineffective channels, as Eagle Eye Vigilance enables you to lodge complaints directly through demand letters. 

5.Whether it's bribery, embezzlement, or any form of misconduct, our app provides a platform for your voice to be heard and your demands to be met.

6.But that's not all - we've included a secret feature that sets Eagle Eye Vigilance apart. With just a simple shake of your device, you can activate the 
discreet recording mode. 

7.This feature allows you to gather evidence on the spot, ensuring that your claims are backed by irrefutable proof. We understand the importance of safety and privacy, which is why we've designed this feature to be subtle and easy to use.
